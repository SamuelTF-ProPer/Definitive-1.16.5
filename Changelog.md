# Level System
You need to invest experience levels into skills that allow you to use certain items / blocks. The requirements arent big enough to require farming, but they still reward players who go out of their way to kill mobs

# Armour Progressionn
Now to make an armour you usually need a a piece of armour from a worse tier, also mod mechanics may be needed to create those armours.
Leather --> Chainmail
Chainmail --> Iron (With the use of create)
Copper and Silver are low tier armour and work on their own

# Villages
Villages look differently now and have been slightly debuffed
- Due to the size difference in villages Aegis spawn rate has been quadrupled and their movement area is 128 blocks around the center of the village
- To debuff how much food players could get from villages hay blocks now give 4 wheat when uncrafted and are crafted with 4 wheat
- Scribe houses spawn weight has been diminished
- Vampirism house spawn weight will be diminished (WIP)
## Flying villages
They are a new structure that happears on the sky
- Aegis dont spawn there
- While they are safe from land mobs flying mobs are still a very big problem, torrets will be added (WIP)
